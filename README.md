The app fetches data from the API (https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/?limit=150) then parses data and creates a list of Pokémon based on each Pokémon's names. Next, once a user clicks on any of the names listed on the app a modal will appear (same as above picture) and the user sees the Name, height and weight of chosen character.
